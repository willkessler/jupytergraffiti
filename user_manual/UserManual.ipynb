    "Jupyter Graffiti are short movies you can add to Notebooks that can illustrate and teach any concept you can think of. It's similar to a screencast, but there's no traditional \"video\"; instead, movies are \"live\", meaning they play back whatever you were doing while recording, right in the notebook cells. Viewers can pause your movie any time and play around in your Notebook to try out whatever you're showing them.\n",

    "* Any changes made to the notebook during playback are rolled back when the movie finishes or is cancelled (so students don't lose any of their own work).  (Via a directive, you can also make changes \"stick\" after a movie completes. This is useful if you want a student to pick up and extend your example.)\n",
    "* Movies only affect the cells interacted with during recording. If you record a movie that only changes the contents of one cell, no other cells are affected during playback.\n",
    "* Because all the Graffiti information is stored in text files inside the `jupytergraffiti_data` directory, you can add that directory to a source-code control system like `git` if you want to manage changes that way (including recorded audio)\n",
    "* All Graffiti in a notebook are loaded when the notebook is loaded (but asynchronously).  Because there is no streaming, we don't recommend making 10 minute long movies-- the audio portion of the download would be large. Instead, try to create many short movies of 1-3 minutes so that the user doesn't wait a long time to see your videos begin.\n",
    "* Graffiti tries to line up scrolling and the cursor as best it can with the cells that were present during the recording. If you delete cells or rearrange the cells, the movies may not play as expected.\n",
    "* If you want, you can even insert old-skool YouTube videos in the tip via the `%%caption_video_id` directive. This way you can add a talking head to your Graffiti before the user starts playing the Graffiti movie.\n",
    "* If you split a Notebook into two notebooks, be aware that the Notebooks will share a Graffiti id. Behavior of movies in two notebooks that share an ID is unpredictable. Via the API you can make a copy of the first notebook and update all its Graffiti ids to new id's, and then delete Graffiti from the second notebook.\n",
    "* If you are inserting more than one Graffiti terminal, you can have it share a single shell. This may help the terminals load faster but be aware that these are all one Jupyter shell now so whatever you type in one shell will appear in all the shells.  The metadata you must modify is at the Notebook level. \n",
    "* In code cells, Graffiti are tied to the \"tokens\" you select, not specific characters. For instance, if you add a Graffiti to the second \"dog\" word in the sentence _The cat, who was friends with the dog, refused to go on a walk with the dog_ then if you insert another _dog_ in the sentence, the Graffiti will appear to move. This is because we just store the fact that the second instance of the word \"dog\" in the code cell has the Graffiti. E.g. _The cat and the dog, who was friends with the other dog, refused to go on a walk with the dog_. The Graffiti will now be shown on the second \"dog\", not the third \"dog\"."
